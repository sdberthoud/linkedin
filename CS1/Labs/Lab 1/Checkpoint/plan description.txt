I plan to first think about how to get the ball to bounce off of the paddles. The first thing that I will do in the code is to draw the ball and make it bounce up and down within the window in order to get a feel of how to get the ball to bounce off od the paddles the right way, it will take a lot of thinking but after bouncing the ball up and down within the window, I will begin to set it so if it hits the paddle, it bounces off.
